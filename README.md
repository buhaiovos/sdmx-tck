# sdmx-tck
SDMX Test compatibility kit (SDMX-TCK) is a tool that certifies the compliance and coverage of RESTful SDMX web services. The TCK is designed to work as a **black box** test tool querying for all the specified resources and features under the SDMX Rest API. A test report summarises the results from the testing, indicating the level of compliance, coverage and supported features.
